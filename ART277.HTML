<hr><p><b>What is Lorem lpsum?</b></p></hr><h7><b>Lorem lpsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
          Lorem lpsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
          took a galley of tpye and scrambled it to make a tpye specimen book. It has survied not only five centuries, 
         but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged . It was popularised in the 1960s 
        with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem lpsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
        like <u><em><b>Aldus PageMarker</b></em></u> including versions of <u>Lorem lpsum</u>. 1914 translation by H.Rackham.</p></h7>
        <h6>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and 
        I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of 
        the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislike, or avoids pleasure itself, because 
        it is pleasure, but because those who do not known how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences 
        that are extremely painful. Not again is there anyone who loves or pursues or pursues or desires to obain pain 
        of itself,because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him 
        some great pleasure.</h6><p><b>Why do we use it?</b></p> <h6>It is a long establisheh fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable 
        content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using <u>Lorem lpsum</U> is that it has a more-or-less normal distridution
        of letter, as opposed to using "Content here,content here", making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages 
        and web page editors now use Lorem lpsum as their default model text, and a search for "Lorem lpsum" will uncover many 
        web sites still in their infancy. Various varions have evolved over the years, sometime by accibent,
        sometimes on purpose(injected humour and the like).</h6> <p><b>Where can I get some?</b></P> <b>There are many variations of passages 
       of Lorem lpsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or <u>randomized words</u> 
        which don't look even slightly believable.</b> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem lpsum, you need to be sure there 
       isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.<em> All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
       perdefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generators on the internet.</em> It uses a dictionary of over 200
       Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem lpsum which looks reasonable. 
       The generated Lorem lpsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or noncharacteristic words etc.</h6>
